Risk. We use proprietary quantitative models in our investment process as described previously. Quantitative models and the associated tools are highly complex, requiring significant specialized experience and expertise to develop, enhance and maintain. Such complexity increases the risk of errors being made in coding and/or the risk of errors that are made failing to be detected. Deviation between model predictions and the actual events can result in either no advantage or in results opposite to those desired by us and our clients. These models draw from historical data that may not predict future returns, volatilities, correlations or market performance adequately.
