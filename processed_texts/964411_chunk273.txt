The financial services industry generally, and the activities of funds and their managers in particular, have been subject to intense and increasing regulatory scrutiny. Such scrutiny increases our and the Arrowstreet Sponsored Fundsâ€™ exposure to potential liabilities and to legal, compliance and other related costs. Increased regulatory oversight also imposes administrative burdens on us and the Arrowstreet Sponsored Funds, including, without limitation, responding to investigations and implementing new policies and procedures. Such burdens may divert our time, attention and resources from portfolio management activities, which could have an adverse impact on the performance of the client portfolios. -29- Arrowstreet Capital,
