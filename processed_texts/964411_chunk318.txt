and “Broker-Dealer Execution and Monitoring” and is subject to monitoring reviews. We currently utilize multiple futures commission merchants and multiple futures execution brokers. Scorecards that evaluate each futures execution broker are completed by Portfolio Management. The scorecard results are shared with the futures execution brokers as part of a periodic evaluation process that ranks such brokers and determines their allocation of order flow for the subsequent quarter. Through reference to the scorecard results, when necessary, futures execution brokers are temporarily suspended and, if their performance does not subsequently improve, they are removed from the list of approved futures execution brokers.
