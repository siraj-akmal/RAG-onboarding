elements of the counterparty relationship are outside of our knowledge and control. Our separately managed account clients are advised in such cases that we may not be able to achieve best execution under these circumstances. Similar practices as described above are followed for the Arrowstreet Sponsored Funds. While we similarly do not have the ability to negotiate rates or seek competitive pricing in such cases, the Arrowstreet Sponsored Funds seek certain assurances with respect to the execution of such trades from their administrators/custodians and seek reporting to permit our evaluation of certain elements of such transactions.
