order with orders for other client portfolios. For example, participation in such programs may result in the client portfolio paying a higher commission rate or receiving less favorable execution than if we had discretion to select the broker-dealer or negotiate the commission rate. Accordingly, it is the clientâ€™s responsibility to satisfy itself about the adequacy of these brokerage arrangements as a whole. In the event we do not retain full discretion with respect to the selection of brokers and / or counterparties and execution of trades, our duty to achieve best execution will be mitigated and, in some cases, eliminated.
