proxy voting service provider, we believe conflicts of interest between our firm and a client in the proxy voting context will be rare. In the event of such conflicts of interest arise, such as if the proxy service provider notifies us of a conflict of interest involving a proxy recommendation, we will exercise discretion as to whether following the proxy service provider is in the best interests of our clients. We provide clients with monthly reports of votes cast on securities in their client portfolios. Clients can also contact Regulatory Compliance by calling 617-919-0000 or via email at regcompliance@arrowstreetcapital.com to
