The scorecard results are shared with the relevant counterparties as part of a periodic evaluation process and to provide post execution feedback to the counterparties. The results of these scorecards are discussed periodically with the Trade Execution Committee. There may be instances where trading may be limited to the use of a single counterparty or comparatively fewer counterparties than otherwise would be prescribed by our customary trading practices. For instance, there may be restrictions imposed by clients (or clients may explicitly direct us to use certain counterparties in trading the applicable portfolio) including as it relates to counterparty credit eligibility
